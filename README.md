### Hey, what's up? 👋

I'm a developer since 2016, however I've got a considerable experience solving problems 🐞, creating solutions 💉 and 💻 coding in **Delphi**, **VB.net** and **C#**.

Currently, I'm working on building a nice portifolio in order to show a little of my work.

**My hobbies are:** 🎮 Playing video games and 🎲 board games, 📚 reading, 📼 watching movies, 🎤 singing and 🎸 playing guitar, 🏃 running, ⚽ sports and the list goes on... 😆
